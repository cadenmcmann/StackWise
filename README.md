A clinical, trustworthy iOS app that provides personalized supplement recommendations based on user health goals, medical history, and preferences.

## 📚 Documentation

### For AI Assistants & New Developers
When working with AI coding assistants (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.), provide these two documents first:

1. **[ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](./ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)** - Complete technical overview of the current implementation
   - App structure and architecture patterns
   - File organization and key components
   - Design system and UI patterns
   - Current implementation status

2. **[TODO.md](./TODO.md)** - Comprehensive development roadmap
   - Features that need to be built
   - Mock services that need real implementations
   - Integration points for backend/AI
   - Prioritized task list

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build the app
make build

# Run on simulator
make run

# Run tests
make test

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```
